🧩 1. Overview

A Community Dashboard & Analytics Portal is a web application that helps you monitor, analyze, and engage with a community — such as users of an app, members of a club, students in a course, or participants in an online forum.

It provides interactive analytics and real-time data to show how active and engaged your community members are.
